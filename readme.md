## ‚Åâ Why is my token here?

If either your <strong>bot</strong> or <strong>user</strong> token is here, it means that it has been found either been found on Replit or somewhere amongst the depths of the internet. 

### Bot developer?
If you are a bot developer, please make sure that you are not accidentally leaking your token.
Where possible, you should use environment variables to store your token, as this hides it from the public.
You can regenerate your bot token by going to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and clicking on your application. From there, you can click on the "Bot" tab and then click "Regenerate Token".

### User?
If you are a user, you have either been hacked or attempted to use a selfbot. Remember, selfbots are against Discord's Terms of Service and result in your account being terminated. 
In either instance, you should change your password immediately.
